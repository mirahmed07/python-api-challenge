## Observation 1:


Southern Hemisphere climates tend to have slightly less (scattered on the plot) humidity than those at similar opposite latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. This is probably because the Southern Hemisphere has significantly more ocean and much less land.


## Observation 2:


Highest temperature is found at 0 latitude (equator) and as the latitude increases or decreases, temperature drops. This happens as equatorial region receives sunlight straight with less or no angle due to curvature shape of earth almost all the year round.


## Observation 3:


Latitude doesn't have a strong influence on wind speed. This stands true for both hemispheres.
